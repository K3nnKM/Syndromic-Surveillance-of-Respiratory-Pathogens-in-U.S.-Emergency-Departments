# Syndromic-Surveillance-of-Respiratory-Pathogens-in-U.S.-Emergency-Departments
This project explores temporal and geographic patterns of respiratory disease burden across U.S. states using syndromic surveillance data from emergency department (ED) visits. I use SQL (MySQL) to build reproducible summary views and Power BI to create interactive dashboards.
